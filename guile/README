This is a guile interpreter with an extension that allows manipulating process
groups (MPI communicators) and basic inter-process communication.

    cd guile
    make
    ./guile-comm

.. and get a Scheme interpreter, try

    guile> (load "test-guile-comm.scm")

MPI does not handle STDIN multiplexing so for parallel
runs execute it in patch mode:

    mpirun -np 4 $PWD/guile-comm -s $PWD/test-guile-comm.scm

Here $PWD might be necessary if mpirun does not respect CWD when spawning
processes.
