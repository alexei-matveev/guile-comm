This is a guile interpreter with an extension that allows manipulating process
groups (MPI communicators) and basic inter-process communication.

    cd guile
    make
    mpirun -np 4 $PWD/guile-mpi -s $PWD/comm.scm

Here $PWD might be necessary if mpirun does not respect CWD when spawning
processes.
